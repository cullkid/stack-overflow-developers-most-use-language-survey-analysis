In this project, I am working with real-life CSV data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, where respondents shared the programming languages they use. As a participant in the survey myself, I gathered valuable insights by applying a series of data pipeline steps to analyze the results using Python and the Pandas library.

Data Pipeline Process:

1. Data Collection: The data was obtained from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which included responses from people regarding the programming languages they use.

2. Data Cleaning: Using Pythonâ€™s csv library and DictReader, I accessed and read the CSV file. The data was cleaned by splitting entries (separated by semicolons) into individual programming languages, ensuring that each language was treated as an individual data point.

3. Data Mining: The Counter function was used to analyze the frequency of each programming language mentioned. This allowed me to determine which languages were most popular among survey participants.

4. Data Analysis with Pandas: I used Pandas to further process and structure the data, applying functions to identify and display the most commonly used programming languages.

5. Data Visualization: After cleaning and analyzing the data, I used matplotlib to create a bar chart, pie chart. This chart helped to visually represent which programming languages were most commonly used according to the survey.

A bar chart was used to visualize the top 15 most commonly used programming languages based on the survey results. This helped to clearly display language popularity in descending order.
A pie chart was used to represent the top 5 most commonly used programming languages, providing a proportional view of the most dominant languages.
The explode parameter was applied in the pie chart to differentiate and emphasize the highest-used programming language among the most commonly used, making it stand out visually.

6. Data Splits: Throughout the process, I ensured that the data was split correctly (by semicolon) to maintain the integrity of each language response.

In the end, the cleaned and visualized data provided clear insights into the programming languages most favored by developers in the Stack Overflow community, and Pandas was an integral part of this data analysis process.
